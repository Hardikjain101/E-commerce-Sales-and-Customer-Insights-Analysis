# E-commerce Sales and Customer Insights Analysis

## **Overview**
This project aims to analyze an extensive e-commerce dataset to derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making. By leveraging advanced SQL queries, data visualization tools like Power BI/Tableau, and predictive analytics using Python, the analysis is divided into three phases: 
1. **SQL Analysis**
2. **Data Visualization**
3. **Predictive Analytics**

The dataset contains information on orders, customers, products, regions, and operational metrics, providing an excellent opportunity to showcase analytical and technical skills.

## **Phases**

### **Phase 1: SQL Analysis**

Objective: Perform deep data analysis using advanced MySQL queries to address business questions related to sales, customers, operations, and time trends.

#### **Key Tasks:**
1. **Sales Performance Analysis:**
   - Calculate total sales revenue per category, sub-category, and region.
   - Identify the top 5 best-selling products by revenue and quantity sold.

2. **Customer Insights:**
   - Identify the most loyal customers by purchase frequency and total spend.
   - Calculate customers with the highest Average Order Value (AOV).

3. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Analyze average delivery time by region.
   - Determine regions or products with the highest canceled rates.

4. **Date and Time Analytics:**
   - Analyze monthly sales trends for the last two years.
   - Identify seasonal sales patterns and peak months.

5. **Advanced SQL Queries:**
   - Use window functions to rank products by sales within categories.
   - Calculate month-to-date (MTD) and year-to-date (YTD) sales metrics.

### **Phase 2: Data Visualization**

Objective: Create interactive dashboards to visualize insights derived from SQL analysis.

#### **Key Metrics to Visualize:**
1. **Sales Performance:**
   - Total Sales Revenue
   - Average Order Value (AOV)
   - Sales by Category and Sub-Category
   - Top-Selling Products

2. **Customer Insights:**
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
   - Top 10 Loyal Customers
   - Customer Segments (e.g., high spenders, one-time buyers)

3. **Regional Analysis:**
   - Revenue by Region
   - Return Rates by Region
   - Average Delivery Time by Region

4. **Operational Metrics:**
   - Delivery Time Analysis
   - Product Return Rates

5. **Time Trends:**
   - Monthly Sales Trends
   - Seasonality Analysis

### **Phase 3: Predictive Analytics (Optional)**

Objective: Use Python to forecast sales, segment customers, and build predictive models.

#### **Key Tasks:**
1. **Sales Prediction:**
   - Forecast monthly sales for the next 12 months using linear regression.
   - Identify key factors influencing sales trends.

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Perform RFM Analysis and clustering to classify customer segments.
   - Label segments (e.g., Loyal Customers, Discount Seekers).

3. **Predicting Product Returns:**
   - Build a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of product returns.

4. **Cross-Sell/Upsell Opportunities:**
   - Use correlation analysis to identify product bundling opportunities.

## **Deliverables**

### 1. **SQL Queries**
- A set of advanced SQL queries addressing all tasks from Phase 1, presented in a structured PPT format.

### 2. **Interactive Dashboard**
- A Power BI/Tableau dashboard highlighting key metrics with screenshots of each page.

### 3. **Python Code and Models**
- Sales forecasting for the next 12 months.
- Customer segmentation results.
